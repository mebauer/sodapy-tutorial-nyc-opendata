# Sodapy Tutorial Using NYC Open Data  
Author: Mark Bauer

# Introduction  
This project demonstrates how to:  
- use sodapy (i.e. the python client for the Socrata API)   
- provides examples of the Socrata Query Language (also known as SoQL)  
- sample analysis notebook using 311 data

Inspiration for this project came from the [sodapy GitHub page](https://github.com/xmunoz/sodapy). Much of what I learned about sodapy, as well as working with the Socrata API, came from these developers. I encourage you to review the official sodapy GitHub page to have a better and more complete understanding of sodapy (e.g. installation, requirements, available methods, basic SoQL queries, etc.). This tutorial is meant to complement the official sodapy docs.

# Data  
The dataset used in this project is [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).
